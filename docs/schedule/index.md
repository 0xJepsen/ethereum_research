# Schedule

We should try to schedule out a rough plan for the first two stages which will be a total of 6 months.

## Stage 1: Learning Period (1-3 months)

Let's write this out as if it is 3x4=12 weeks total.

### Week 1: 
- Read the relevant research level papers for Poseidon and FRI and write up a summary of each. (This is a top-down approach)
- Determine what citations from those documents to follow up on.
- Read basic level material that has been suggested to us to determine what resources are the best for learning the material from the ground up. (This is a bottom-up approach)

### Week 2:
- Consolidate a list of resources for learning the material from the ground up.
- Read the relevant research level papers cited from Poseidon and FRI and write up a summary of each.
- Consider if there are more citations from these to track down. 
- Consider reading other relevant ZK/crypto research papers such as Plonk.

### Week 3:
- Continue to gain familiarity with the research level papers and speedrun the lower level material.
- Start taking our own notes on the material to build a more speedrunnable guide into ZK security.
- Look into Github repositories for Poseidon and FRI to see if there are any tests that we can run to gain familiarity with the code.

### Week 4:
- Begin reading up on attacks to the security assumptions of Poseidon and FRI.
- Consolidate material from previous weeks.
- Create a first deliverable. Perhaps an overview of what we have learned at this stage.

### Week 5:
- Dive deeper into breaking these primitives.
- Find more types of attacks
- Gain familiarity on the types of attacks (e.g., Grobner basis attacks, etc.)
