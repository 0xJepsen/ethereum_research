>[Boneh, D., & Shoup, V. (2020). A graduate course in applied cryptography. Draft 0.5.](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/cryptobook/BonehShoup_0_4.pdf)
The book is intended to be self contained. 
Some supplementary material covering basic facts from probability theory and algebra is provided in the appendices. The book is divided into three parts.
The first part covers symmetric encryption which explains how two parties, Alice and Bob, can
securely exchange information when they have a shared key unknown to the attacker.
The second part developes the concepts of public-key encryption and digital signatures, which allow
Alice and Bob to communicate securely, without having a pre-shared secret key.
The third  is about cryptographic protocols, such as protocols for user identification, key exchange, zero knowledge, and secure computation.

>[Rosulek, M. (n.d.). The Joy of Cryptography.](https://joyofcryptography.com)
"The Joy of Cryptography" is an accessible, undergraduate-level textbook that provides a comprehensive introduction to the principles of modern cryptography. 
The author, Mike Rosulek, emphasizes a deep understanding of the subject, focusing on provable security aspects and offering insight into how cryptographic protocols are constructed to resist various attacks. 
The book is known for its clear explanations and practical examples, making complex concepts approachable. 
It's particularly useful for students and practitioners who wish to gain a solid grounding in cryptography without getting overwhelmed by overly technical details.

Springer New York.](https://github.com/isislovecruft/library--/blob/master/cryptography%20%26%20mathematics/An%20Introduction%20to%20Mathematical%20Cryptography%20(2014)%20-%20Hoffstein%2C%20Pipher%2C%20Silverman.pdf)
"An Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography" by Hoffstein, Pipher, and Silverman is a highly valuable resource for those seeking a deep understanding of the mathematical principles in cryptography. 
Its thorough coverage of both classical and modern cryptographic techniques, combined with a clear explanation of underlying mathematical concepts, makes it great introductory matterial. 
The book strikes a balance between theory and practice, offering insights into the practical applications of the discussed mathematical methods. 
Its comprehensive approach ensures that readers gain a solid foundation in cryptographic principles.

This has become one of the hallmark resources for learning about zero-knowledge proofs. 
The book takes you through both the theory and practice of zero-knowledge proofs. 
There is little background required and I would describe the book as comprehensive and approachable.

>[Wong, D. (2021). Real-world cryptography. Simon and Schuster.](https://www.manning.com/books/real-world-cryptography?a_aid=Realworldcrypto&a_bid=ad500e09)
Real-World Cryptography teaches practical techniques for day-to-day work as a developer, sysadmin, or security practitioner. There’s no complex math or jargon: Modern cryptography methods are explored through clever graphics and real-world use cases. You’ll learn building blocks like hash functions and signatures; cryptographic protocols like HTTPS and secure messaging; and cutting-edge advances like post-quantum cryptography and cryptocurrencies. This book is a joy to read—and it might just save your bacon the next time you’re targeted by an adversary after your data.
